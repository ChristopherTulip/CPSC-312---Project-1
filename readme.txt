Oska

Oska is played on a board like that shown below. The two players face each other across the board. Each player begins with four pieces, placed one to a square in each of the four squares nearest that player.

The player with the white pieces makes the first move, and the players alternate moves after that. A player may choose to move one of his or her pieces in one of these ways: 
 
 A piece may be moved forward on the diagonal, one space at a time, 
 to an empty space, as in checkers or draughts. 
 
 A piece may jump forward on the diagonal over an opponent's piece 
 to an empty space, thereby capturing the opponent's piece and 
 removing it from the board. This capturing move is again like that 
 seen in checkers or draughts. Unlike checkers, however, only a 
 single capture is permitted on one turn; multiple jumps are not 
 allowed. Also, even if a capture is possible, it does not have to 
 be made if other moves are possible. 
 
The players alternate moving pieces until one of the players wins. If a player can't make a legal move on a given turn, the player loses that turn and the opponent makes another move. A player wins when: 
 
 All the opponent's pieces have been removed from the board, 
 
 or 
 
 All the player's REMAINING pieces have been moved to the opponent's 
 starting (or back) row. Note that this rule makes the strategy for 
 this game most interesting. A player may want to sacrifice pieces 
 in order to have fewer pieces to move to the opponent's starting 
 row. But this approach carries some risk in that every sacrificed 
 piece brings the player closer to having all of his or her pieces 
 removed from the board, thereby losing the game
